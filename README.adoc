This is a rust implementation of the
https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0274_1.2.0.pdf[SPDM]
protocol specifically designed to work well with
microcontrollers and async networking in application level code. It is a `#[no_std]` codebase and
performs zero heap allocations. It also attempts to minimize the number of built in stack
allocations, deferring allocation of any memory to the user of this library.

IMPORTANT: This repo is under active development and subject to change at any
time without notice. Implementation of the protocol is not yet complete.

== Navigating

* `src/crypto/` - Traits and implementations for cryptographic primitives
* `src/msgs/` - All messsages defined by the protocol. Requests and response
messages are bundled together into a single file.
* `src/requester.rs` - Contains the `Requester` type for use directly by the
user.
* `src/requester/` - Individual states for the requester side of the protocol.
These are wrapped and transitioned in the `Requester` type.
* `src/responder.rs` - Contains the `Responder` type for use directly by the
user.
* `src/responder/` - Individual states for the responder side of the protocol.
These are wrapped and transitioned in the `Responder` type.
* `test-utils/` - Tools used for development and testing. Primarily certificate
generation so far.

== Design

The code follows the state machine of the SPDM protocol as closely as possible, and provides
safety to the user via the https://cliffle.com/blog/rust-typestate/#continue-reading[typestate
pattern]. Message exchanges for different phases of the protocol are split up
into individual matching states in both the requester and responder. For
example, version negotiation lives in the `requester::version::State` and
`responder::version::State` types, while challenge authentication lives in the
`requester::challenge::State` and `responder::challenge::State`. By putting the
logic for each part of the protocol inside its own state, we minimize the
cognitive overhead necessary when reading the code, and can ensure explicitly
that only messages appropriate to that state are handled. We can also test each
state individually, and ensure that state transitions are appropriate. 

While the typestate pattern is useful for helping to ensure implementation
correctness at compile time, it is really most helpful for users of libraries
when the typestates themselves vary in capability such that the states present
different APIs based on those capabilities. This allows visibility to both the
user and compiler of the progression of library usage so that one can see
clearly that state 1 is complete, and now state 2 is in progress. As in the
example given in the blog post above, typestates for an HTTP response may
progress through the `StatusLine`, `Header`, and then `Body` states such that
only appropriate content may be filled in by the user, and no state skipped
before the response is completely generated. This example also shows that since
each of these types are concrete, it is easiest to use them immediately and
cycle through all of them *in order* inside a function before returning control
flow to the caller. If the specific order of states is unknown at compile time,
a wrapper enum would be needed to permit "saving" of a single "current" type
between control flow contexts.

With the SPDM protocol we do have distinct states and a flow between them driven
by the protocol specification and the configured capabilities of a specific
deployment. However, what we do not have, is satisfaction of the
other two conditions that make typestate based APIs ergonomic for users:

 1. Significantly different API surfaces.
 2. The ability to walk through all states of the protocol deterministically, in
order.

We do not have the first condition, because the SPDM protocol logic is well
defined, and not driven directly by the user outside of configuration. As
transport specific logic is manged by the user application, each requester API
consists primarily of getting the next serialized request in the protocol to
send, and then calling `handle_msg` with the serialized response when it is
received. The basic responder API for each state is even simpler, and consists
solely of a `handle_msg` method which receives a request and returns a
serialized response to send. The remote nature of the client-server protocol,
and the possiblity, particularly in the responder, of unknown state transitions based on
message receipt, eliminates the second condition. 

With the lack of these two conditions, it turns out that regardless of
transport, the user ends up writing very similar code that cycles through all
the states, taking into account any minor differences in API parameters, and
wrapping output states into an Enum. Most importantly, **every** user of this
library has to write this similarly tedious code, and spend the time to lookup
and understand all the different states in the SPDM protocol, possibly making
subtle mistakes along the way. Instead, what we want is to maintain the clarity
and safety of typestate based protocol code, but vastly simplify the user
experience.

What we have done to enhance the ergonomics of this library is to implement
wrapper `Requester` and `Responder` types that maintain a consistent API across
all states when appropriate. The underlying states themselves are not used
directly, and the user no longer needs to understand the internals or message
flow of the SPDM protocol. In short, this library becomes much easier to use.
Usage of the `Requester` and `Responder` types and their APIs are described in
the following two subsections.

=== Requester API

The above section was actually a bit misleading. We do use a typestate based API for the
requester, but the typestates are not the protocol states. They instead relate to
the two distinct phases of the protocol important to a user of this library:

 1. Secure session initialization
 2. Application level messaging

The first phase is fully autonomous in that besides configuration, the user does
not have to specify what messages get exchanged. They just have to run the
protocol to completion and ensure messages get sent and received over transport
that they themselves maintain. This phase is encapsulated in the
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/bf40def68f149b3f17f25a4f296aaddfb634c6f3/src/requester.rs#L64-L70[RequesterInit]
state.

The second phase is where the user sends encrypted and/or authenticated messages
over a secure SPDM channel, and also can retrieve measurements on demand. This
is the
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/bf40def68f149b3f17f25a4f296aaddfb634c6f3/src/requester.rs#L72-L77[RequesterSession]
state. While the SPDM protocol allows retrieval of measurements outside of a
secure session, there isn't much benefit to doing this, except for a slight
reduction in overhead. By logically separating the two phases, we make the
system easier to use. We can always provide a method for the `RequesterSession`
state that allows retrieving measurements outside the secure session if desired.

NOTE: The `RequesterSession` state is not yet implemented and the
`RequesterInit` state is incomplete.

The pseudocode below shows an example of using the requester states.

[source,rust]
----
let transport = initTransport();
let root_cert = getRootCert();
let slots = someCertificateSlots();

let mut write_buf = [0u8; MAX_BUF_SIZE];
let mut read_buf = [0u8; MAX_BUF_SIZE];

// Assume for now all slots share the same root cert
let mut requester = RequesterInit::new(&root_cert, &slots);

let mut initialization_complete = false;
while !initialization_complete {
    let request = requester.next_request(&mut write_buf)?; 
    transport.send(request)?;

    // Subslice of read_buf returned
    let response = transport.recv(&mut read_buf)?;
    initialization_complete = requester.handle_msg(response)?;
}

// Time to make the donuts!
let mut requester = requester.begin_session();

// The following is all speculative, as the API is not yet created.

// Get measurements
let request = requester.measurement_request(&mut write_buf)?;
transport.send(request)?;
let response = transport.recv(&mut read_buf)?;
let measurements = requester.handle_measurements(response)?

// Do something with measurements
...

// Serialize application level data.
// Assume a buffer is owned by the application code and a slice is returned.
let app_req = generate_some_app_request()?

// Send an encrypted/authenticated request and decode the response
let request = requester.secure_request(&mut write_buf, app_req)?;
transport.send(request)?;
let response = transport.recv(&mut read_buf)?;
let app_response = deserialize(requester.handle_secure_response(response)?)?;

// Do something with app level response
...

----

=== Responder API

Session establishment is not yet differentiated in the `Responder` API, as all
the code required to create a session has not been completed, and it's unclear
if there should be two typestates here like in the requester. This section will
instead show an example of how to use the Responder API as it currently exists.

First though let's take a look at the API for the primary method of the
`Responder`.

[source,rust]
----
pub fn handle_msg<'b>(
    &mut self,
    req: &[u8],
    rsp: &'b mut [u8],
) -> (&'b [u8], Result<(), ResponderError>);
----

When a request is received over the transport, it arrives as a slice. A mutable
buffer with which to write the response is passed in, and a tuple containing a
slice referring to that buffer with the actual data written, and a result is
returned. This is a curious, and somewhat unidiomatic API, so it is important to
understand its motivation. The rationale for this, is that there is almost *always*
data written to the buffer, even if an error occurs. The written data in that
case is the error response, which will be an empty slice if no response needs to
be written. The caller can then send the response over the transport regardless
of if an error was received or not, and then respond to the error as
appropriate. In most cases this likely means closing the transport and dropping
the Responder.

It's also important to state again, that we haven't yet worked out what this API
will look like during the application phase of the protocol. The signature may
change or we may transition to a new typestate that returns application level
requests to the caller and allows manual replies.

Example usage of this API in existing code is shown below.

[source,rust]
----
let req_buf = [0u8; MAX_BUF_SIZE];
let rsp_buf = [0u8; MAX_BUF_SIZE];
let transport = init_transport()?;

let slots = someCertificateSlots();

let mut responder = Responder::new(slots);

loop {
    let request = transport.recv(&mut req_buf)?;
    let (response, result) = responder.handle_msg(&req_buf, &mut rsp_buf);
    transport.send(response)?;
    if let Err(err) == result {
        return Err(err);
    }
}

----

=== Messages and Encoding

SPDM Defines a binary encoding for all messages. This encoding does not follow a
grammar, and so reading(deserialization) and writing(serialization) is done by
direct ad-hoc implementation. To ease development,
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/bf40def68f149b3f17f25a4f296aaddfb634c6f3/src/msgs/encoding.rs#L47-L127[Writer]
and
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/bf40def68f149b3f17f25a4f296aaddfb634c6f3/src/msgs/encoding.rs#L205-L377[Reader]
classes are provided. 

Each message in the SPDM protocol doc consists of a 4-byte header, followed by
message dependent fields for the remainder of the message. However, while all 4
bytes are required for each message, only the first two bytes share meaning
across messages, with byte one representing the message code, and byte two the
version. Because of this, our implementation defines the header as two bytes, and
each message implements (de)serialization of the remaining two header bytes as
if they were part of the body. When implemented this way, the user only has to
write the message specific serialization and deserialization code, while the
rest can be provided from the shared
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/bf40def68f149b3f17f25a4f296aaddfb634c6f3/src/msgs/mod.rs#L39-L93[Msg]
trait methods.

=== Configuration 

Because this library is a `no_std` codebase intended to run on resource
constrained microcontrollers, buffer sizes must be defined at compile time.
Additionally, builds may target specific platforms with support for hardware
assisted cryptography, which must also be known at build time. Therefore, a rust
configuration is generated by a
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/bf40def68f149b3f17f25a4f296aaddfb634c6f3/build.rs[build
script] which consumes a
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/bf40def68f149b3f17f25a4f296aaddfb634c6f3/spdm-config.toml[TOML
file]. The build script
 https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/bf40def68f149b3f17f25a4f296aaddfb634c6f3/build.rs#L156-L185[fills
 in]
a
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/bf40def68f149b3f17f25a4f296aaddfb634c6f3/config.rs.template[template]
 to generate the actual configuration based on the contents of the TOML file.

This template generation is straightforward without the need for a dependency, although it may be safer to use a
name based generator rather than relying on argument position. 

It should also be mentioned that we plan to drive the requester state
transitions for the session initialization phase via the capabilities present in
the configuration. For example, if pre-shared keys are in use via `PSK_CAP`,
then the states managing PSK related message exchanges will be utilized. In this
case the mutually exclusive `CERT_CAP` which indicates usage of digests and
certificates will not have its related states entered or messages exchanges 
performed. To be more concrete: If `PSK_CAP` is enabled then the following
message exchanges will be implemented:

 * `PSK_EXCHANGE` - `PSX_EXCHANGE_RSP`
 * `PSK_FINISH` - `PSK_FINISH_RSP`

The following, mutually exclusive message exchanges will not be implemented if `PSK_CAP` is
enabled:

 * `GET_DIGESTS` - `DIGESTS`
 * `GET_CERTIFICATE` - `CERTIFICATE`
 * `KEY_EXCHANGE` - `KEY_EXCHANGE_RSP`
 * `FINISH` - `FINISH_RSP`

Additionally, no signing will be available for measurement requests or challenge
response.

The benefit of driving the requester state machine through configuration is that
the user of this library does not have to be aware of the details of the
implementation and ensure proper state machine flow manually.

=== Platform specific code

All platform specific code must be abstracted into traits. Implementations
should live behind cargo features or our build time TOML based configuration. This
determination is TBD.

==== Cryptography
All code that is part of this library must be `no_std` compliant. That includes
cryptography. Currently all software RSA implementations in rust require
dynamic allocation, which is not permitted here. This is also fine, because
really, you shouldn't be using RSA if something else is available.

Currently, only
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/bf40def68f149b3f17f25a4f296aaddfb634c6f3/src/crypto/signing.rs[signing] and 
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/bf40def68f149b3f17f25a4f296aaddfb634c6f3/src/crypto/pki.rs[verification]
based on ECDSA and SHA(3)_XXX
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/main/src/crypto/digest.rs[digests] are
implemented. These implementations are backed by
https://github.com/briansmith/ring[ring] and
https://github.com/briansmith/webpki[webpki]. 

While not currently done, we intend to put all crypto implementations behind
cargo features or the toml based configuration. This will allow utilization of
HW based implementations when needed. We can perhaps even allow people to opt-in
to allocation based implementations, although that seems like it may be a bridge
too far.

Another important part of the SPDM protocol is that it allows up to eight slots
of certificate chains to be used for different purposes. We encode this functionality
in the
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/bf40def68f149b3f17f25a4f296aaddfb634c6f3/src/crypto/slot.rs[FilledSlot] abstraction which describes the algorithms used by the given
certificate. 

Note since each slot, even if empty,  takes up a memory buffer of
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/bf40def68f149b3f17f25a4f296aaddfb634c6f3/config.rs.template#L7-L9[MAX_CERT_CHAIN_SIZE],
we allow restricting the number of slots available to an implementation when
more are not needed and memory pressure is significant. This can be done via the
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/spdm/blob/bf40def68f149b3f17f25a4f296aaddfb634c6f3/config.rs.template#L5[NUM_SLOTS]
configuration value.

==== Measurements

The `MEASUREMENTS` message, and trait interface is not yet implemented. 

=== Thoughts on Upgrade

SPDM is a versioned protocol with negotiation up front. We are planning to
support versions 1.2 and later. As such, when we end up implementing more than
one version of the protocol, only the negotiated versions of messages will be
sent and received. It's possible that we also will implement separate states for
these messages and transition the requester and responder state machines via the
negotiated version in a manner similar to that done with capabilities in the
requester. Whether or not separate states in the underlying state machines are
utilized depends on how large of a jump the protocol takes and whether or not
only a few fields are added to different messages. In some cases, as in the
difference between version 1.1 and 1.2 of the SPDM specification, we can simply
not support 1.2 capabilities such as message chunking, and not send related
fields. This may not always be the case however, and we should be open to more
complex methods to maintain code clarity and safety.

== Testing

All messages should have at least round-trip serialization tests. Some states
also have unit tests. An example that steps through a complete happy path of the
currently implemented protocol for both requester and responder exists in the
link:tests/protocol.rs[successful_e2e] integration test.
